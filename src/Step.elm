{-| A `Step model msg a` describes one state transition of an application, and is inteneded to be what gets returned from an update function.

It's helpful to look at how a `Step` is (roughly) represented under the hood

    type Step model msg a
        = To model (Cmd msg)
        | Exit a
        | Stay

We provide a smart constructor for each of these variants, but we hide the internal representation to make sure you're not pattern matching on `Step`s willy-nilly.

That being said, if you find something that makes you want the data structure fully exposed, please make an issue on GitHub!

-}
type Step model msg a
    = To model (List (Cmd msg))
    | Exit a
    | Stay


{-| Transition to a new state, without executing any commands
-}
to : model -> Step model msg a
to state =
    To state []


{-| Keep the interaction in the state it was in.

**Note**: This will prevent any commands from being returned

    Step.stay == (Step.stay |> Step.withCmd myHttpCall)

If you want to stay in the same state, but run some commands, use `Step.to` explicitly

    Step.to MySameState |> Step.withCmd myHttpCall

-}
stay : Step model msg a
stay =
    Stay


{-| End the interaction by returning a value of type `a`
-}
exit : a -> Step model msg a
exit =
    Exit


{-| If we're stepping `to` a new state, add an cmd to fire off

This can be called on a `Step` multiple times, and all the commands will fire.

No commands are fired if the Step turns out to be a `stay` or an `exit`

Alternate name ideas:

  - effectfully
  - cmd
  - command (provided below)
  - yelling
  - with

{-| Apply a function to the state inside a `Step`, if it's there

Most useful for building a `Step` out of another `Step` returned from some other update function you're calling

        Stay ->
            Stay


{-| Apply a function to any `msg`s in the `Step`'s commands

Often used alongside `map` for building "bigger" `Step`s out of "smaller" ones

-}

mapMsg f step =
    case step of
        To state msgCmd ->

            Stay


{-| Run the first suceeding `Step`, with priority given to the second argument

Intended to be used pipeline style

    Step.to { loading = True } |> Step.orElse (Step.to { loading = False }) == Step.to { loading = True }

    Step.noop |> Step.orElse Step.to { loading = True } == Step.to { loading = True }

{-| Choose a `Step` based on the result of another interaction

You can use this in combination with `map` and `mapMsg` to glue the end of one interaction to the beginning of another.

Notice that it looks a lot like `Maybe.andThen` and `Result.andThen`, but operating on the last type variable.

-}
onExit : (a -> Step model msg b) -> Step model msg a -> Step model msg b
onExit f step =
    case step of

            f o

        Stay ->
            Stay


{-| Turn a `Step` into the usual TEA update tuple

It must be a `Step` that doesn't `exit`. We know it is if the type variable `a` is still lowercase, i.e. not a specifc type, and can thus be chosen to be `Never` when calling this function.

-}

{-| Starting from an initial state, fold an update function over a list of messages

Only use this to test that the application of certain messages produces the result you expect. In application code, building up a bunch of `Msg`s just to feed them to an update function is ususally not worth the effort.
